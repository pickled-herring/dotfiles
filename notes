To install you need to backup your current system.
Make that easier by adding a backup into the Makefile.

Should also changed how bin is bootstrapped onto the system.
Currently we remove any bin folder that was there before through ln -sf
We shoud figure out how to integrate our own bin without moving the bin folder
of the user.
