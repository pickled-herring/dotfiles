DOTFILES

DESCRIPTION
	This repository contains my configuration files, or dotfiles. This
	collection of dotfiles value self sufficiency - They should be able to
	work with any system post installation with minimal hassle, and
	generalization - They should be flexible in their configurations.
	Whether these files achieve this or not is up for debate.

	The current dotfiles work best with Ubuntu Desktop systems running
	unity. This is because I wrote them to unify my working environment for
	both my home computer and university lab machines (which run Ubuntu
	Desktop).

QUICK INSTALL
	make

TRACKING FILES
	The bootstrapping uses make for simplicity reasons. Makefiles are easy
	to run from the user's perspective and are well known by everyone
	competent at programming.

	When make is called, the files are symlinked into your home directory
	so any changes you make to the files from your home directory will be
	reflected immediately in the dotfile repository.

	If you want to update the dotfiles (assuming you have either forked,
	cloned or switched to a new branch) you can update the repository
	quickly by running:

	make commit
	# Then typing in your commit message
